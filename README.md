# Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using transformers in Python. It leverages pre-trained transformer-based models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, to perform sentiment analysis on text data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library from Hugging Face

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-transformers.git
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

3. Prepare the data:

Place your sentiment analysis dataset in a text file, where each line contains a text and its corresponding sentiment label (positive or negative). Make sure the file is formatted as follows:

```
I really enjoyed the movie!   positive
The plot was confusing.       negative
...
```

## Usage

1. Fine-tuning the Models:

Fine-tune the BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet models on your sentiment analysis dataset by running the `train.py` script:

```bash
python train.py --model bert-base-uncased --dataset path/to/dataset.txt --output_dir path/to/output_directory
```

Replace `bert-base-uncased` with the desired model architecture. The trained models will be saved in the specified `output_directory`.

2. Evaluating the Models:

Evaluate the trained models on a validation or test dataset using the `evaluate.py` script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model path/to/trained_model --dataset path/to/validation.txt
```

Replace `path/to/trained_model` with the path to the trained model checkpoint, and `path/to/validation.txt` with the path to the validation dataset.

3. Sentiment Analysis:

Perform sentiment analysis on individual text inputs using the `analyze_sentiment.py` script:

```bash
python analyze_sentiment.py --model path/to/trained_model --text "I really enjoyed the movie!"
```

Replace `path/to/trained_model` with the path to the trained model checkpoint, and `"I really enjoyed the movie!"` with the text you want to analyze.

## Advanced Techniques

The project also demonstrates the implementation of advanced techniques to enhance the sentiment analysis model:

- Data Augmentation: Back-translation technique is used to generate augmented data by translating and back-translating the original text.
- Model Ensembling: Multiple pre-trained models are ensembled to improve prediction performance.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: The project includes an example of hyperparameter tuning using a grid search approach to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

Feel free to experiment and extend the project with additional techniques, model architectures, or hyperparameter configurations to further improve the sentiment analysis model.
